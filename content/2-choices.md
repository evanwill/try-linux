## Distributions

Part of the fun of getting started with Linux is choosing a distro, but there are so many it can also be very overwhelming.
Most distros are a package of technical low-level stuff, plus a desktop and selection of basic applications.
Some are focused on running servers, others on desktop users.

Here are some things to consider:

- **Out-of-the-box experience.** Do you want it to just work or are you willing to spend time customizing? Do you want all the applications pre-installed (openSUSE) or minimalist (Arch)?
- **Community.** Do you want to search online and find hundreds of answers to your questions (Ubuntu), be part of a values driven community (Fedora), or get involved in a smaller forum of deeply invested enthusiasts (Arch)?
- **Repositories.** Some distros have huge repos of applications (Debian), making installing new software secure and easy. Some are more up-to-date than others (Fedora). Others are more DIY (Arch). Some distros package only free and open software that meets their community guidelines (Fedora); others include commonly used, but non-free software, such as MP3 encodings (Ubuntu).
- **Ecosystem.** Do you use a Linux server at work or some hobby project? Choose a distro from the same family to make life easier.
- **Hardware support.** Unlike Windows, with Linux you don't have to install a bunch of drivers to get everything to work. However, some distros support a huge range of legacy hardware, while others have better support for the newest hardware built in. It is often difficult to run high performance graphics cards with out specific distro support. Distros have different versions of the Linux Kernel--the newest have upgraded features and performance baked in, but have less of the kinks worked out.
- **Updates.** Do you want to install an OS that will be supported for a LONG time so that you won't have to upgrade or do you want the latest-and-greatest? Distros typically follow either a rolling or fixed release. *Rolling release* distros have a continuous stream of updates, you always have the latest software and never have to upgrade to a new version (but may encounter some instability). *Fixed release* are more traditional and stable with incremental versions that require a large upgrade every so often. Fixed releases are often broken into latest and LTS (long term support)--if you want to install once, and use the system for years without needed to upgrade, choose an LTS. For example, Ubuntu normal releases are officially supported for nine months, LTS for five years.
- **Installer!** In the past, Linux distros were confusing to install, a major barrier to adoption--Ubuntu really changed that, and some installers are still friendlier than others. 
    - **Secure Boot UEFI**. If you have a newer computer, it will have Secure Boot UEFI which is only supported by the bigger Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE)--otherwise you will have to tweak your UEFI / BIOS to get the installer to work.
    - **Dual booting.** Do you want to keep windows? Some installers make it easy (Ubuntu).

My easy suggestion: use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) or an [Ubuntu flavor](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours).
The installer is easy to use (supports easy dual booting with Windows) and hardware support is great.
It also has the largest beginner and intermediate user community, so help is always easily at hand via blogs, wikis, and forums--if you search for general Linux help majority of answers are about Ubuntu.
If a piece of software provides Linux instructions or packages, it will include Ubuntu.

## Desktop Environment

Next, you will have to choose your desktop environment (DE)--the graphical interface you will be staring at all day!
Unlike windows, mac, or chrome, with Linux distros you have a choice of desktops.
It is separate from the core of the distro and can be installed independently.

Generally, you will choose a package pre-bundled with a DE, most distros will give you several options, with GNOME, KDE, and Xfce being most common.
Distros often tweak their versions of the desktops, so the final look, default software, and features vary a bit. 
Just take a look at their screenshots and decide! 

But here are a bunch more details...

Things to consider:

- Weight. How resource intensive is it? Slicker desktops (GNOME, KDE) require modern hardware to run well. If you have an old computer or low spec hardware, go light (Xfce, LXqt)!
- Configurability. How much do you want to tweak the look and feel? Do you want it to just look good out of the box?
- Unique vs. traditional. Do you want something different (GNOME) or are you nostalgic for the old days (Cinnamon)?

See [Major Desktop Environments](#major-desktop-environments) below for lots more detail... 

## 64 or 32

One last choice you might have to make is 64 or 32-bit?
Many distros have started to phase out 32-bit support, but you may still encounter the choice to download "64-bit" / "x86_64" / "AMD64" versus "32-bit" / "i386" / "i586".
If your computer is still running, it is likely new enough to be 64-bit, so I would suggest ignoring 32-bit options unless you know your hardware requires it.
Some distros now also support ARM processors, such as found in Raspberry Pi, so you may encounter an option like "ARMv7".
