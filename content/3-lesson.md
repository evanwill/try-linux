## Content Pages

Content pages are written in markdown and can be enhanced using Liquid includes that are packaged with the template.
Start by editing the examples or creating new files in the "content" folder.

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to [simplify writing](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/writing-markdown.html) content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.
The basics are intuitive, you can learn in about a minute!
See [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html) to get started.

At the top of each page is "YML front matter" used to configure the page.
Use these options:

- to include a page in the header and footer navigation, add `nav:` push the text you want to appear to the file's yml front matter. Alternatively, add `nav: true` to use the page's `title:` value. All pages with a `nav` value will appear in the top-bar, sorted by order of filenames. For simplicity use leading numbers in the lesson page filenames to create correct order.
- `title:` value will appear as `h1` at the top of the page.
- `topics:` will appear as a small feature below the title (optional). 
- `description:` will appear as an indented text block below the title (optional). This gives you a chance to summarize the section contents. 
- `youtubeid:` will add an YouTube video embed (optional). Find the id in the YouTube link. For example, in `https://youtu.be/moJgWrD6dwg` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJgWrD6dwg` the youtubeid is `moJgWrD6dwg`.
- Alternatively, if you don't want `title` or other options to appear on the page, you can over ride the layout by adding `layout: default` 

## Components Includes

`workshop-template-b` contains a series of [Liquid "includes"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) to add basic [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/) to your Markdown content.
Examples below demonstrate the includes.

--------

#### Figures 

`{% raw %}{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include figure.html img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" alt="workshop scene" caption="Library workshops!" width="75%" %}

----------

#### Alerts

`{% raw %}{% include alert.html text="This is a Bootstrap [Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}{% endraw %}`

{% include alert.html text="This is a [Bootstrap Alert](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/)" align="center" color="success" %}

#### Cards

```{% raw %}
{% capture text %}
1. Can add more complex text using markdown.
2. Use a Liquid capture to create the text.
3. It magically becomes a [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/).
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html text=text header="Example Card" title="Title example" img="uidaho-workshop.jpg" %}{% endraw %}
```
