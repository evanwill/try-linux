{% include figure.html img="tianyi-ma-WiONHd_zYI4-unsplash.jpg" alt="laptop opening with light" %}

Want to get started with Linux on your laptop? 
This workshop will introduce the most popular operating system in the world! 
Although most people are more familiar with Windows or Mac, Linux OS runs the vast majority of web servers, super computers, smartphones, TVs, and other electronic devices. 
You can also use desktop versions for free on your laptop or home computer. 
And you can try it out without installing or changing your hard drive!
