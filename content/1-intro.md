## What is Linux?

Linux ([pronunciation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Linus-linux.ogg)) is a family of open source operating systems (OS).
You might hear "Unix-like" or "*nix", since Linux is part of a group of OS descended from the early research computing system [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).

An OS is made up of a many components, basically:

- **Bootloader:** starts the low level processes necessary to boot an OS, most linux distributions use [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).
- **Kernel:** manages the hardware and low level software components, coordinating the complete OS. This is actually "[Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)".
- **Shell:** text-based command line interface.
- **Desktop environment:** graphical interface .
- **Applications:** individual programs run from the desktop or shell.

The core of Linux, the [kernel](https://www.kernel.org/), is developed by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/) and original creator Linus Torvalds, with contributions from thousands of people and corporations around the world.
Linux operating systems are usually shipped as a complete package of components called a distribution, or "distro".
There are hundreds to choose from, each with different philosophies, strengths, and use cases.

## Why Linux?

Linux core is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), meaning cost-free and freely licensed, giving you **freedom** (as in [freeeeeedoooom](https://youtu.be/n9D7oeM3zd8))!
You can control, inspect, modify, copy, and share the OS. 
But for most users, that is not necessarily the most compelling reason to use Linux. 
Instead they just appreciate a solid, powerful, and user-friendly OS.
Linux provides security, privacy, stability/reliability, customization, and cost benefits, in addition to access to a huge ecosystem of open-source applications and services.

Linux runs the vast majority of web servers (95%+), super computers (all of the top 500), smart phones (80%+), Chromebooks, IoT, and single board computers. 
So if you want to use a VM in the cloud, do high performance computing, or tinker with a Raspberry Pi at home, it's helpful to know Linux.
But it also makes a great desktop OS for your personal computer!
Thus, there are many practical *and* ideological reasons to use Free and Open software.

> Bloatware, adware, viruses, oh my! 
> Many people are sick of the shady commercial practices of Windows, Apple, and PC manufacturers that put user security and privacy at risk.
> Proprietary OS limit your rights and control as a user.
> Linux distros are viable alternatives!
